Impersonate chrome BoringSSL JA3 fingerprint to pass request sent using Rustâ„¢Â® (ðŸ¦€ ðŸš€) through Cloudflare and Akamai.\
Live in harmony with nature and don't waste more valuable energy on running headless browser to bypass simple thing!\
\
Symptoms of website using JA3 fingerprint that this repo can help solve:
- returns 403 and requires you to pass js/captcha challenge when requested programmatically even with same headers as browser
- page when visited first time from modern browser loads instantly without "Checking your browser" WAF.

## Credits and resources
- https://github.com/4JX/reqwest-impersonate - it is fork of reqwest, hyper and h2 which requires to be updated to 
upstream. Currently, in my case I can't even manage it to work due to different versions of hyper in project and,
unfortunately, I can't keep it in sync with reqwest, hyper and h2 upstream. It is more advanced,
and it also tries to impersonate chrome http2 fingerprint, but I think my composition of raw hyper and boring will be
easier to maintain (basically no maintenance related to reqwest updates) and it is currently enough for my usage.

## Usage
```rust
use boringhyper::ChromeHeadersExt;
use hyper::{Body, Request};

async fn visit_cf() {
    const ENTERPRISE_CF_URL: &str = "https://www.canva.com/pl_pl/";

    let client = boringhyper::create_client();
    let req = Request::builder()
        .uri(ENTERPRISE_CF_URL)
        .with_chrome_headers()
        .body(Body::empty())
        .unwrap();
    let mut resp = client.request(req).await.expect("Could not do request");
    assert_eq!(resp.status(), 200);
    // Since WAF requires header "accept-encoding: gzip(, deflate, br)" to be sent,
    // `boringhyper` contains extension on hyper::Response to read body decompressed if 
    // server replied with compressed content.
    // See: `ReadBodyExt::read_body`.
    let body = resp.read_body().await.expect("Could not read body");
    let body_str = String::from_utf8_lossy(&body);
    println!("Response body: {body_str}");
}
```
